# CS2520 Assignment 6
Group 6
Members: Matthew Bui, Wesley Dam, Darren Nguyen

Program Functionality:
- D key - Switch from day and night
- L key - Turn the field lights on and off

The purpose of assignment 6 is for us to modify the graphics_v4.py program in a functional form. It focuses on organizing the code in a way that is easy for the reader to distinguish what the code does and allow for easy modifications of some objects. This was all done to our completed program graphics_v4.4.py file. This code outputs a soccer field with its lines and goal with the net, a stadium to the left and right of the field, two lightpoles, a fence, and a sky with clouds when there is the stars when there is the moon.

Our group modified the original file by encapsulating its code in well-documented functions. We also added extra customizability by allowing the user to do things such as customize the window size and title, define cloud positions, and alter the size, number, and position of stars, among many other things.
